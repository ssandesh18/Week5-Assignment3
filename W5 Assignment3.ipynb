    "Q1.What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. Multithreading improves the performance of applications by running the task simultaneously. Better Responsiveness: Multithreading improves the responsiveness of your backend applications by running threads after a task is blocked. Threading Modules. The threading module is a high-level implementation of multithreading used to deploy an application in Python. To use multithreading, we need to import the threading module in Python Program.\n",

    "Q2. Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions  \n",
    "Python multithreading is a powerful technique used to run concurrently within a single process. Here are some practical real-time multithreading use cases: User Interface Responsiveness: Multithreading assists in keeping the responsiveness of a Graphic User Interface(GUI) while running a background task1. \n",
    "•\tthreading.activeCount() − Returns the number of thread objects that are active.\n",
    "•\tthreading.currentThread() − Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.\n",

    "Q 3. Explain the following functions\n",
    "•\trun()  − The run() method is the entry point for a thread.\n",
    "•\tstart()  − The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.\n",
    "•\tjoin([time])  − The join() waits for threads to terminate.\n",
    "•\tisAlive()  − The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing\n",

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "1. Improved Performance: The principal advantage of multithreading is increased performance. By allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously, CPU idle time is reduced, leading to improved performance especially on multi-core and multi-processor systems.\n",
    "2. Better Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance responsiveness in interactive applications. For example, in a user interface, one thread can manage user input, while another handles graphical updates. This prevents the application from hanging or becoming unresponsive.\n",
    "3. Resource Sharing: Threads of the same process share memory and resources, enabling efficient inter-thread communication compared to processes, which require more complex and slower inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "4. Simplicity of Modeling: In applications that naturally have multiple independent tasks running concurrently (like a multiplayer online game), using multithreading can simplify the modeling and programming of such applications.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "1. Synchronization Issues: The major challenge with multithreading is managing concurrent access to shared resources. Issues such as deadlocks, race conditions, and thread interference can occur if the threads are not properly synchronized.\n",
    "2. Debugging Difficulty: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more complex than single-threaded ones due to unexpected interaction between threads. Identifying and reproducing errors can be challenging.\n",
    "3. Overhead and Context Switching: Each thread requires its own stack, which increases memory overhead. Additionally, frequent context switching between threads can lead to increased CPU time usage, reducing overall efficiency.\n",
    "4. Complexity: Writing and maintaining multithreaded code can be more complex and error-prone than single-threaded code due to the need for synchronization, and handling of thread-safe and re-entrancy conditions.\n",
    "6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.What is a Race Condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "When two processes are competing with each other causing data corruption\n",
    "two persons are trying to deposit 1 dollar online into the same bank account. The initial amount is 17 dollar. Both the persons would be able to see $17 initially. Each of them tries to deposit $1, and the final amount is expected to be $19. But due to race conditions, the final amount in the bank is $18 instead of $19. This is also known as dirty read.\n",
    "For example, if two processes/threads are trying to execute the following conditions simultaneously, they cause data corruption:\n",
    "Thread 1:\n",
    "total = num1 + num2\n",
    "Thread 2:\n",
    "total = num1 - num2\n",
    "It is very common for the race conditions to go unnoticed during testing even after multiple tests and code reviews. But in production, there would be a lot of processes and threads working parallelly and compete for the same resources, and this problem would occur.\n",
    "What is a Dead Lock?\n",
    "When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock.\n",
    "This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task. But the resource R2 is acquired by thread T2 which is waiting for resource R1(which is acquired by T1).. Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for the other resources they need.\n",
    "process 1 is waiting for process 2 and process 2 is waiting for process 3 to finish and process 3 is waiting for process 1 to finish. All these three processes would keep waiting and will never end. This is called deadlock.\n"
